## Purpose

Performing cleaning and Statistical Analysis of "Hollywood's Most Profitable Stories" dataset with R and Data Visualisation on Power BI.

## Techniques

### 1. Data cleaning.

Checking missing values.  

Removing duplicates and rounding the values to maintain accuracy and avoid misleading statistics.

Checking for outliers using a boxplot.
Methods such as IQR criterion by using boxplot.stats()$out and function which() to extract the row number corresponding to these outliers, z-score and Hampel filter by using median() and mad() functions.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis 

This set of statistics describes where data values occur, their central tendency, variability, and the
general shape of their distribution. 

Univariate (bar charts, histogram) , bivariate (scatter plots) and multivariate analysis for multiple variables.

### 3. Data Visualization on Power BI

Creating dashboards by using Rscripts with different packages(ggplot, reshape2, dplyr, ggthemes, ggridge, plotly, rgl etc) and collections of functions for bar chart and density plot.
